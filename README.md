# Gameified6835FinalProject
This is our final project for 6.835 Multimodal Interfaces and Programming at MIT.\

We will use a Kinect to track and give will time feedback as people complete exercises such as push-ups and squats.

All of the files for running the python is in pythonimplementation. Everything else was just code we tried at the beginning.  


Notes:

I had to run "brew install mpg321" to download the command for the audio text to speech to work.

It is likely you may have to install several libraries/packages via pip install or some equivalent. But you should be prompted to do so. 

Also had to run these commands to install

pip install playsound

sudo pip install pyobjc
