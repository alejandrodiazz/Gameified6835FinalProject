# Gameified6835FinalProject
This is our final project for 6.835 Multimodal Interfaces and Programming at MIT.\

We will use a Kinect to track and give will time feedback as people complete exercises such as push-ups and squats.



Notes:

I had to run "brew install mpg321" to download the command for the audio text to speech to work.
